LS_RE_ECON_POSITIVE_RAREFIND: Rare Archaelogical Find
LS_RE_ECON_POSITIVE_RAREFIND_DESC: <<
	Scientists discovery an archalogical mystery from a previous race on [target=Location/].
	Do we ignore or extract
>>
LS_RE_ECON_POSITIVE_RAREFIND_IGNORE: Ignore
LS_RE_ECON_POSITIVE_RAREFIND_EXTRACT: Extract
LS_RE_ECON_POSITIVE_RAREFIND_IGNORE_MSG1: Occasionaly rumors of technology failing in this away come away, no one is sure way. Although those visiting seem to become healthier
LS_RE_ECON_POSITIVE_RAREFIND_IGNORE_MSG2: After uncovering even though left alone sometimes there's occasional bursts of some unkown energy. This appears to impact the planets communications occasionaly harming the economy
LS_RE_ECON_POSITIVE_RAREFIND_IGNORE_MSG3: Although left alone it becomes a toursit spot
LS_RE_ECON_POSITIVE_RAREFIND_IGNORE_MSG4: Left alone, nothing happens Yay
LS_RE_ECON_POSITIVE_RAREFIND_EXTRACT_MSG1: An ancient virus was inside. Now released although able to cope the population growth suffers
LS_RE_ECON_POSITIVE_RAREFIND_EXTRACT_MSG2: <<
	Upon opening a signal was sent to deep space. It is not known what was signalled.

	(TO Do - lead to new event of what it signaled, may be good, may be negative)
>>
LS_RE_ECON_POSITIVE_RAREFIND_EXTRACT_MSG3: <<
	We discover some ancient technology, that has allowed minor improvements to our support ships health.
	+1% support ship health
>>
LS_RE_ECON_POSITIVE_RAREFIND_EXTRACT_MSG4: Although no major breakthroughs, some interesting data existed
LS_RE_ECON_POSITIVE_ENERGYSURGE: Energy Surge
LS_RE_ECON_POSITIVE_ENERGYSURGE_DESC: An energy Surge has occured on [target=Location/]. How do we deal with it
LS_RE_ECON_POSITIVE_ENERGYSURGE_CONTROL: Attempt to Control
LS_RE_ECON_POSITIVE_ENERGYSURGE_IGNORE: Ignore it
LS_RE_ECON_POSITIVE_ENERGYSURGE_CONTROL_MSG1: <<
	Suscesfully controlling the surge led to a better understanding.
	Energy up by 5%
>>
LS_RE_ECON_POSITIVE_ENERGYSURGE_CONTROL_MSG2: Safe and sound, nothing happens
LS_RE_ECON_POSITIVE_ENERGYSURGE_CONTROL_MSG3: <<
	Failed at controlling leading to a temporary blackout

	Energy income down by 5%
>>
LS_RE_ECON_POSITIVE_ENERGYSURGE_CONTROL_MSG4: <<
	Suscesfully controlling the surge led to a better understanding.
	Labor up by 5%
>>
LS_RE_ECON_POSITIVE_ENERGYSURGE_IGNORE_MSG1: Catatstrophe, the electrical surge led to a blow out a FTL research centre, something appears to have been pulled through a subspace rift above the planet
LS_RE_ECON_POSITIVE_ENERGYSURGE_IGNORE_MSG2: Energy Down by 5%
LS_RE_ECON_POSITIVE_ENERGYSURGE_IGNORE_MSG3: The surge seemed to have given unexpected results and led to early completion of some high energy experiements
LS_RE_ECON_POSITIVE_ENERGYSURGE_IGNORE_MSG4: Hospitals Crashed, population growth down
LS_RE_ECON_POSITIVE_ENERGYSURGE_IGNORE_MSG5: Nothing happened somehow
