LS_PLT_FIRST_FORGE_DESC: <<
	An ancient First Forge World that was locked in a subspace.
	Released from the prison and the creature that was sealed with it destroyed the planet is free to reclaim.
	It appears to be fully functional still and we have inserted some compatible designs of ships to be produced.

	At Level 3 - Automatically produce Scout Class Vessels
	At Level 5 - Automatically produce Battleship Class Vessels

	[b] WARNING[/b] This planet was infected once, who knows if it might happen again or worse, if the ships produced from this might be infected
